## PSX Web Scraper & Data Logger

A Python-based web scraping project that automatically extracts real-time KSE-100 index data from the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) and logs it into a structured CSV dataset for analysis. This project demonstrates data collection, automation, and analysis workflows from web scraping to data storage and visualization-ready output using Python’s data ecosystem.
## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Automated Scraping: Continuously fetches live KSE-100 index data at fixed time intervals.
- 📈 Real-Time Tracking: Captures index value and percentage change from PSX.
- ⏱️ Time Logging: Records timestamps to enable time-series trend analysis.
- 💾 CSV Export: Stores clean, structured data for later analysis or visualization.
- 🧰 Error Handling: Handles connection and parsing errors gracefully for reliability.
## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup and Requests
- Data Collection & Cleaning with Pandas
- Data Automation & Scheduling using loops and time intervals
- Data Storage in CSV format
- Documentation & Version Control using Git and GitHub
